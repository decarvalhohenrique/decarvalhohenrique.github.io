Hi, I'm Henrique de Carvalho and I am a Corporate Lawyer turned Data Scientist! 

I've always loved technology, but over the last year I became really obsessed with data analysis, and mainly with machine learning and its revolutionary applications.

This blog serves as a record of my attempts to use data analysis and machine learning techniques to understand and solve problems, and, of course, do some really cool stuff!

I would be happy to know your story and your comments on my blog.
