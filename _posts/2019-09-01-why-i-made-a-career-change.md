description: A little bit of my story

For the past months the topic of why I left corporate law and became a Data Scientist has been a big part of my conversations with people. 

The real answer is as simple as “because I really wanted to”. While this is true, people do not regard this as enough reasoning, nor would this make a good blog post, so I decided to make my first blog post ever a quick attempt to express the motivations behind why I really wanted to leave corporate law and become a Data Scientist.

The questions that should be answered are why I chose Law in the first place and why I did not drop earlier to pursue another career. And I believe the answers are related to where I come from, how other people's beliefs have the potential to influence one's lifes decisions, and how bad situations raise awareness.

I come from a provincial city in the northeast region of Brazil, where pursuing what you love in life is an overrated decision. A person’s profession should be a mean to a financial reward and being very well paid is not only desirable, it is the very purpose of working. 

When the time came to make a decision about what I would do with my life, technology related areas were not even an option. Mainly because these areas were not perceived as highly paid professions, and thus were not perceived as worthy of our time. This happened, however, due to the existence of an enourmous information asymmetry between this region and the rest of Brazil, and the world. What makes traditional careers the only possible careers for good students.

Therefore, I was left with the decision to pick one out of three options: be a Doctor, be a Lawyer, or spend the rest of my life explaining to my family and everyone else why I didn’t pick one of the first two.

I remember being fascinated with robotics, but not feeling confident enough to tell others about it. Even now, a robotics engineer would never be seen as a valuable profession as Medicine or Law. 

So, when it comes to answering why I chose Law in the first place, I believe that I received a lot of career advices that were simply not good. Maybe these advices would have been good for me if I had stayed in my hometown, as they seemed to be good enough for the majority of my friends, who decided to pursue either Medicine or Law and live happily with their decision. 

Leaving my hometown to study in Brasilia, Brazil's capital, and later to work in São Paulo, Brazil's biggest city, gave me a broader vision on career and life goals, and finally the courage to leave my highly more than average paid job to find out what I wanted in life.

One thing I knew, I wanted more than a mapped-out career, more than getting a diploma from a fine university in a traditional field, and certainly more than working for top corporate law firms. I wanted to really love what I did, to take pride in it, to feel as a part of something bigger than myself. Things that my previous job was not providing to me.

The fear of being trapped in something that I did not love started to wear me out. Work filled a large part of my life, so it made no sense to settle. Nothing justified not taking risks to find what I thruly loved.

Ever since I can remember, I have always taken interest in computers and new technology. This intensified in recent months before I resigned my job.

I had just recently learned how startups worked, and I was obsessed with how applications of machine learning had been reshaping business and research. I was fascinated with it, I would read everything I could get my hands on and I could not wait to understand how all of that functioned from underneath.

So while still working in my previous job, I started to learn things on my own, and soon enough I was spending all my spare time learning. Programming, marketing, data analysis, machine learning applications, even design. I was very passionate about this new world, something that Law was never able to do to me.

So it did not take long before I decided that I had found something I was passionate about, and that I had to drop everything to pursue that passion.

It was not an easy decision to take. I was filled with self-doubt and the fear of facing the disapproval of my family and some of my friends. Even now I still face it sometimes. But I knew, from the very bottom of my heart, that I had to make this decision, that I had to take advantage of finding something I loved.

In the end, I came out of all this with the best decision of my entire career and a lesson to never again take other people's advice over my intuition. Because, eventually, my desire to learn more about technology had always been there, and my motivations behind my decisions should not matter. It all comes up to really wanting to. If I really want to, then I should do it.
