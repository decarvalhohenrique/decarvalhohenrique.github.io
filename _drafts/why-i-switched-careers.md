For the past months why I left Corporate Law and became a Data Scientist has been big part of my conversations with people. 

Actually, the answer is as simple as “because I really wanted to”. While this is true, people do not regard this as enough reasoning, nor this would make a good blog post, so I decided to make my first blog post ever an attempt to express what lead me into technology and out of Corporate Law.

Where I come from, pursuing what you love in life was pan overrated decision. Your profession should be viewed as a mean to a financial reward.

Mainly of all, at 17, you know absolutely nothing about any of these things. Not just because you haven’t experienced in practice any of the professions you are being encouraged to pursue by going to College, but because we do not learn anything about careers at school.

Looking back, I can say this was a decision marked with psychological oppression. Mainly from where I came from, you are lead to believe that you just won’t be anybody   

I think that it always comes to I was not proud of what I do. Now I think that
